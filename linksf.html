                            <p>Zendesk has something called Volunteer Engineering which is a quasi-team working on Link-SF, San Francisco’s first mobile-optimized website that connects homeless and low-income 
                                residents with critical and life-saving resources nearby. After a tech lab with user testing last week, they received a lot of user feedback with many very simple to-dos.

                                <br>
                                As a result, my friend, Emmett Ling who was working there as a Software Engineer Intern decided to commission this little app redesign project, which I took on.

                        <p class="problem-body">For most of the users, Link-SF was either previously unknown or difficult to access. People normally used Google or Word of Mouth to access resources prior to this.
                            Although they found it useful after they learned how to use it, there were several recurring points of friction and accessibility.

                        To further understand the problem, some of these frictions, and the ways that the product was not very accessible we decided to investigate, by conducting interviews.

                        About 5 people were interviewed and they were males in their 30s - 50s. We did not have the chance to do talk with women or other demographics. Although this does not 
                        give us a wide range of information about all potential users, this is a fairly representative of the homeless population for the sample size.

                    We started thinking of ways to tackle the problems we found. Our ideas went from improving the marketing of this product, 
                    figuring out ways to let people know about it, to adding more resources on the new design.

                 <p class="content-p col-2">
                    Keeping the HMW question and the redesign goal in mind, I started creating the information architecture and Low-Fi concepts for LINK-SF using Balsamiq. 
                    I created different iterations, experimenting to see the best layout for listing out the resources.

                Checking in with my team, I got some feedback based on the iterations I created. We decided to go with the second iteration because the first one contains 
                horinzontal scrolling which might be counter-intuitive to some people, and that defeats the goal of making things easy to navigate. We decided to keep it as simple as possible. 
                I moved on to Sketch and starting making the wire-frames.

                The current design doesn’t have any existing design guideline established. It did not have any set color, or components and since I was adding most of these things and creating an

                It’s a product created by Zendesk so I tried to still show that by using some of Zendesk’s brand color.

                Again, with the aim of making the navigation as simple as possible, we removed the menu button at the upper left corner. It wasn't necessary since everything was laid out on the user Interface.
                I made two iterations where the search bar was located at different places. I decided to have it in the Nav bar because it will be fixed which will make it readily available for the user.
