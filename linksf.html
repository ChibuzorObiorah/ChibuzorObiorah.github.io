                            <p>Zendesk has something called Volunteer Engineering which is a quasi-team working on Link-SF, San Francisco’s first mobile-optimized website that connects homeless and low-income 
                                residents with critical and life-saving resources nearby. After a tech lab with user testing last week, they received a lot of user feedback with many very simple to-dos.

                                <br>
                                As a result, my friend, Emmett Ling who was working there as a Software Engineer Intern decided to commission this little app redesign project, which I took on.

                        <p class="problem-body">For most of the users, Link-SF was either previously unknown or difficult to access. People normally used Google or Word of Mouth to access resources prior to this.
                            Although they found it useful after they learned how to use it, there were several recurring points of friction and accessibility.

                        About 5 people were interviewed and they were males in their 30s - 50s. We did not have the chance to do talk with women or other demographics. Although this does not 
                        give us a wide range of information about all potential users, this is a fairly representative of the homeless population for the sample size.
