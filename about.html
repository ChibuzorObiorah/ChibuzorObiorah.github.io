                            I am a junior at the University of California, Berkeley, studying Cognitive Science and Design Innovation.
                            Outside of my classes, I am a product design consultant at <a class="content-link" href="https://berkeleyinnovation.org/">Berkeley Innovation</a>, a student-run human-centered design 
                            consultancy on campus, and I also work as the student program manager at the <a class="content-link" href="https://ais.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Academic Innovation Studio</a>.
                            <br>
                            I’m a designer who enjoys empathizing with others and putting my users’ 
                            needs at the forefront of every process.  
                        </p>

                            After a fireworks accident caused me to lose vision in my right eye, it wasn't long before I began realizing the 
                            resulting inconveniences in my life. Some of these things were minute and not too hard to navigate around, but 
                            it certainly made me consider what life might be like for someone who is fully visually impaired. This left me 
                            thinking about disabilities as a whole. I started to realize how inaccessible certain things are around us and how the 
                            structure and design of everyday things and spaces can make an impact on how people navigate through life. In essence, 
                            I started seeing the power of design.  From my observations, time after time, I have seen how accessibility has been left 
                            as after thought in the design process. 
                            <br>
                            When we make accessibility an after-thought, we contribute to the othering of people with disabilities. 
                            This issue doesn't solely affect people with disabilities, it impacts the lives of other marginalized 
                            communities (racial/ethnic minorities, socio-economic category, etc). This realization has made me passionate about designing for accessibility, and becoming a strong advocate for inclusivity. During the design process, 
                            I strive to make sure all user groups are accounted for. As a designer, I have that superpower!

                            To challenge myself, to grow in my coding skills, to make something unique and to stand out amongst the hundreds of talented designers out there, I decided to code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   my portfolio from scratch. I took on the task and tackled it using the Human-Centered Design process. 
                            With my main users being recruiters, design managers and hiring managers, I started from research, learning about my users, to ideation, all the 
                            way to prototyping. In the beginning, It was exciting.
                            Coding it was not an easy task, which is probably because I embarked on this journey after a web-design class, with very little knowledge on how to even make things responsive. 
                            It was painful at times  without realizing, an hour later, that I linked the wrong CSS file to my HTML document. stressful, because of the time span. I am a student, taking classes, and trying to live my life as a young adult, what was I thinking. But. Lo and behold, after all the stress and pain. I finally finished. 
                            I started as a beginner coder and now I am more proficient in my front-end coding skills. I learned to be disciplined, to turn of distractions and get work done!  It's my most precious creation till date. I am so proud of myself and I will keep updating my portfolio!
